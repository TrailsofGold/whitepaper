A player buys one or more pirates (NFTs) from the app (in-app purchase) in order to start playing.

While playing he/she can get gold (PGLD) and rum (PRBT).

Gold and rum can be spent into the Shop to buy NFTs (ships and items).

Money collected by the in-app purchases is sent to DAO Treasury.

PGLD collected by the Shop is also sent to DAO Treasury, PRBT is burnt.
