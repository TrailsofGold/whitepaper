# Enhancement Costs and Max Levels

**⚓ Leveling Costs & Progression System**

#### **🔹 Leveling Mechanics**

* **1 Level = 1 Chest's Worth of Gold**
* Due to the **dynamic nature of our PvP tokenomic modeling**, the **value of 1 Chest** will **vary for every player each day** based on in-game calculations.

#### **🔹 Maximum Levels**

**🏴‍☠️ The Captain**

* **No Max Level** – Captains can continue to level infinitely, increasing their strength and efficiency over time.

**🚢 Ships**

Each ship type has a **maximum level cap** to maintain game balance:

* **Fleet Commander's Ship** – **Max Level: 100**
* **Gold Ship** – **Max Level: 100**
* **Silver Ship** – **Max Level: 100**
* **Bronze Ship** – **Max Level: 100**

**🧭 Treasure Map**

* **Max Level: 100** – Determines how many treasure sites a player can explore per day.

**⚒️ Items**

* **Max Level: TBD** – Item progression and scaling will be revealed in future updates.

#### **🌊 Adaptive Progression for a Competitive Edge**

With the **PvP-driven tokenomic system**, **leveling is dynamic**, ensuring that **no two players experience the same growth path**. Players must **strategize upgrades wisely** to maintain a competitive edge in _The Seven Seas: Trails of Gold, Rising Tides, and Fleet Command_.

⚓ **Sail forward, level up, and become a true legend of the high seas!** 🏆\
