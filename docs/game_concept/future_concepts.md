# future\_concepts

**Seven Seas** is designed to be an ever extending game world.

As such new concepts will be added in a near future. Among them are...

### Privateers

A player wanting to increase his/her crew skills without buying new pirates each time, may hire privateers lended by another player.

Players will have to pay privateers with PRBT.

Players lending their pirate will be rewarded by a share of the lender rewards (in proportion of his/her pirate involvement in a hunt).

### Buired treasures

A player will be able to bury an amount of PGLD and will be rewarded with a share of PGLD as long as his/her remain buried (staking mechanism).

### Pirate council

A DAO with PGLD as gouvernance token. The council will vote ecosystem missions and spendings, and influence the game roadmap.

### Marooning

A player with at least 5 pirates of the same rarity level will be able to marron them (burn them actually) to get one pirate of the upper rarity level.

For example, marooning 5 common pirates will give the player one rare pirate (5 marooned rare pirates will give one epic pirate, and so on...)

### Bribing

A player will be able to use his/her PGLD or PRBT to bribe some game rules and then:

* reduce crew rest time
* get a hint to fin the treasure containing the most PGLD during a hunt
* ...
