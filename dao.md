# dao

**Seven Seas** was designed with the Web 3 mindset from the start, and aims at becoming as decentralized as possible , as soon as possible.

To do so, the game treasury is managed by a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

The DAO is accessible from here: https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/polygon/0x3e3c022c0d76cb53b8963a3836f379886f880a43/dashboard.

### A game that belongs to its players and contributors

DAO voting power is granted by the PGLD token. Which means that any holder of PGLD token is defacto a DAO member and has a say on every DAO proposal.

Players become members as soon as they start finding their first treasure. The more they play, the more they earn PGLD, the more they increase their voting power (if they keep their PGLD tokens of course).

Contributors become members as soon as they get rewarded for their first contribution to the game, as the DAO rewards every contribution with PGLD tokens.

?> See [Contributing](docs/governance/governance/contributing.md) to learn more about contributors.

### Roles of the DAO

DAO treasury controls PGLD token minting (but max supply is limited to 21 000 000).

It is also the recipient of every presale / sale (from external markplaces, or in-app).

?> See [Token Distribution](docs/governance/tokenomics/token_distribution.md) for more information about PGLD token allocation.

#### Before game start

During the build / pre-launch phase, the DAO will mint PGLD to reward contributors.

#### At game start

At game start 50% of the total supply will be minted to the game reward pool. The remaining amount to mint will be kept under DAO control.

A liquidity pool of PGLD/MATIC will be created on Uniswap to list the PGLD token.

?> Read [PGLD Token](docs/governance/tokenomics/pgld_token.md) to learn more about PGLD and PGLD listing.

#### After game start

While game is running, the DAO will be responsible to:

* Keep the game attractive
* Keep the game sustainable
* Promote the game

To do so it will be in charge of (non exhaustive list):

* Rewarding contributors
* Providing token liquidity
* Funding ecosystem

### Decentralization

At the start DAO will be more or less centralized, as initial contributors come from [inside|app](https://www.insideapp.fr), the company that initially designed and built the game.

However the goal of the DAO is to progressively:

* Enrich the contributors community (with people coming from outside inside|app)
* Increase the DAO control over the game. that is: not only decide day to day treasury management, but also geting involved into game design and incoming features through proposals.

?> Checkout [Contributing](docs/governance/governance/contributing.md) to know how to become a contributor.

### Proposals

Any PGLD token holder can submit and vote on proposals to the [DAO](https://app.aragon.org/#/daos/polygon/0x3e3c022c0d76cb53b8963a3836f379886f880a43/governance).

Here are the rules for proposal submission:

* Proposal must be discussed with the community before being submitted.
* Proposal must be written in English.
* Proposal must be written in a formal and respectful tone.
* Proposal should stick to the template provided in this whitepaper.
