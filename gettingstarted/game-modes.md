#### Explorer Mode

**Description:**\
Step into the boots of a true adventurer! In Explorer Mode, you actively roam the world using the Trails of Gold app to seek out hidden treasure dig sites. Every expedition you embark on is a chance to uncover secrets, solve puzzles, and discover chests brimming with the full 100% bounty of rewards. Whether you’re trekking through bustling city streets or venturing into the wild unknown, your every step writes a new chapter in your treasure-hunting adventures.\

**Journey Mode**

**Description:**\
Not every treasure hunt needs to be a grand expedition—sometimes, simply being on the move is enough. In Journey Mode, the app tracks your daily activities in the background, ensuring that even your everyday journeys contribute to your quest. Although the chests you unlock carry 75% of the rewards compared to active exploration, each discovery is a testament to your steady progress. Embrace the rhythm of your daily route and watch as even routine travels pave the path to hidden riches.
