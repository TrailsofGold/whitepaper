# Game Modes

### **Game Modes: Explorer & Journey Mode**

_The Seven Seas: Trails of Gold_ offers two distinct ways to hunt for treasure, allowing players to **choose their own adventure**—whether through **active exploration** or **passive progression**.

#### **🌍 Explorer Mode – Become a True Adventurer**

**Step into the boots of a fearless explorer!** In **Explorer Mode**, you actively roam the world using the **Trails of Gold** app to seek out **hidden treasure dig sites**. Every expedition presents an opportunity to:

* **Uncover secrets** hidden in the world.
* **Solve puzzles** that lead to legendary rewards.
* **Discover treasure chests** packed with **100% of their bounty**.

Whether you're trekking through **bustling city streets** or venturing into **uncharted landscapes**, **every step** you take writes a **new chapter** in your treasure-hunting legacy.

#### **🚶‍♂️ Journey Mode – Turn Every Step into Progress**

Not every treasure hunt requires a **grand expedition**—sometimes, simply **being on the move is enough**.

In **Journey Mode**, the app **tracks your daily activities in the background**, ensuring that even your everyday movements contribute to your quest. While treasure chests unlocked in this mode **carry 100% of the rewards, they require 25% additions steps to claim your chest** compared to Explorer Mode.

* **Commutes, errands, and casual walks** all contribute to your treasure hunt.
* Maintain a **passive progression path**, ensuring rewards without constant active play.
* **Watch as even routine travels** bring you **one step closer** to **hidden riches**.

#### **Choose Your Adventure**

Whether you prefer the **thrill of the hunt in Explorer Mode** or **earning treasure through daily movement in Journey Mode**, _Trails of Gold_ ensures that **every step counts**.
