### **Deckhands & Captains ‚Äì Ship System**

#### **Deckhands: Rowboats & Their Journey**

Deckhand players start their adventure aboard **rowboats**, a humble but essential means of navigating the open seas. These small vessels allow Deckhands to **explore**, **search for treasure**, and **prove their worth**. However, rowboats come with limitations:

* **Limited Strength** ‚Äì Only **5% of total Strength** is realized in this mode.
* **Basic Navigation** ‚Äì Slower movement and reduced efficiency in treasure hunting.
* **Path to Promotion** ‚Äì Deckhands must **earn their way to Captain status** by securing a ship.

Deckhands can advance to **Captain Mode** by either:

1. **Purchasing a Genesis Ship** from the in-app store.
2. **Finding a Fleet Commander** in the Discord community willing to promote them.
